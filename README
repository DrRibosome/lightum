lightum - MacBook automatic keyboard brightness daemon
(c)2011 Pau Oliva Fora - pof[at]eslack(.)org

This program implements automatic keyboard brightness on MacBookAir4 by reading
the light sensor value and adjusting the keyboard brightness accordingly.

Usage:  lightum [-m value] [-p value] [-f]
        -m 1..255 : maximum brightness value between 1 and 255 (default=255)
        -p num    : number of seconds between light sensor polls (default=8)
        -f        : run in foreground (do not daemonize)
        -v        : verbose mode, useful for debugging with -f

Typical usage is running it as daemon, it will poll the light sensor value
every 8 seconds by default, you can change this value with -p parameter.

The keyboard brightness will be set to maximum when the sensor reports there is
no light, you can change the maximum value with -m parameter, this value ranges
from 1 to 255.

Enjoy! :)
